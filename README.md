# Blockchain-based eCommerce warranty system using NFTs

## Use-cases - 
Issuing NFT based product warranty to the buyer after purchase, removing the need of imperfect physical warranty
Allowing users to easily trace the warranty (view details such as expiry date, serial no. etc.) and have transferable warranties wherever applicable
Offering brands or retailer to provide digital certificate of authenticity via NFTs for every product sold, tied to product serial and model number
GUI based tool for brands and retailers to add products and specify product warranty details without much technical knowledge
Allow various gamifications mechanics to improve user brands interactions and promote the brands and he products

## Proposed approach - 
Created simple webportal that allow retailers to add product and warranty details such as name, model no, price, description, warranty period, soulbound/normal NFT
Created a web portal for user that replicates flipkart where user can buy products.
User signs up with details such as name, email, phone and crypto wallet address
User can buy any product listed on the website as usual
Upon a successful purchase, NFT for the product warranty is generated with all the product details (name, model no, serial no, warranty expiry date, soulbound/normal NFT etc.)
The NFT will be issued to the buyer after minutes of purchase and the details will be shared with the buyer through email and sms
User can see product warranty NFT on OpenSea (Largest NFT Marketplace)
Warranty NFT can be soulbound (Non-Transferable) or Normal (Transferable) as specified by the retailer
The NFT will be automatically revoked after the expiry date

## Tools and Functioning - 
Frontend - ReactJs, Backend - NodeJs/MongoDB
When a product is added the NFT contract with all the product details will be deployed and contract address will get stored in the database
User can buy any product listed on the website as usual
Upon a successful purchase,that product’s contract address will be fetched from the database and the NFT will be issued using the smart contract’s mint function  
The NFT will be issued to the buyer after minutes of purchase and the details will be shared with the buyer through email and sms
User can see product warranty NFT on OpenSea (Largest NFT Marketplace)
NFT metadata(model No, serial No, name, expiry date) is stored in IPFS and the link generated by it is passed to the smart contract’s mint function. 
A cronjob (job scheduler) runs every night at 1:00 am which checks the database for expired warranties and revokes them.
